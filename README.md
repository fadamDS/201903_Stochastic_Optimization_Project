### Who's hot and who's not? Uncovering consistency in NBA players using Hidden Markov Models

#### Project for the Stochastic Optimization Course for the Masters in Data Science at BGSE  - Felix Adam, Julia Barnett, Oscar Martinez and Guillem Sitges

In this project we try to uncover hot and cold states for NBA Basketball players. Assuming an underlying hidden markov model, we estimate transition and emission probabilities using the Baum-Welch algorithm.
